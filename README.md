# Name Game

The most competitive name reveal in history!

## Rules

- This game is a mix of Wordle and Mastermind.
- For every guess, you'll see how many letters are correct, and how many letters are correct but in the wrong spot.
	- üü¢ = Correct letter in right spot
	- üü° = Correct letter in wrong spot
	- ‚ùå = No correct letters
- The trick is you won't know WHICH letter is correct. You'll have to figure that out with your guesses. Guess wisely!
- When we say a letter is in the wrong spot, we're always determining the spot from the start of the name.
	- Meaning, if the name ends with a "Z": _ _ Z, and you guess _ _ _ _ _ _ Z, we'll give you a üü° because while the last letter is "Z", it's not in the 7th position as you guessed.
